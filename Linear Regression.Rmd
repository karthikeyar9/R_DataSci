<h3>Anscombe's Quartet/Stratification
</h3>

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(HistData)
data("GaltonFamilies")


set.seed(1983)
galton_heights <- GaltonFamilies %>%
  filter(gender == "male") %>%
  group_by(family) %>%
  sample_n(1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(father, childHeight) %>%
  rename(son = childHeight)

# number of fathers with height 72 or 72.5 inches
sum(galton_heights$father == 72)
sum(galton_heights$father == 72.5)

# predicted height of a son with a 72 inch tall father
conditional_avg <- galton_heights %>%
    filter(round(father) == 72) %>%
    summarize(avg = mean(son)) %>%
    pull(avg)
conditional_avg

# stratify fathers' heights to make a boxplot of son heights
galton_heights %>% mutate(father_strata = factor(round(father))) %>%
    ggplot(aes(father_strata, son)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    geom_point()

# center of each boxplot
galton_heights %>%
    mutate(father = round(father)) %>%
    group_by(father) %>%
    summarize(son_conditional_avg = mean(son)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(father, son_conditional_avg)) +
    geom_point()

# calculate values to plot regression line on original data
mu_x <- mean(galton_heights$father)
mu_y <- mean(galton_heights$son)
s_x <- sd(galton_heights$father)
s_y <- sd(galton_heights$son)
r <- cor(galton_heights$father, galton_heights$son)
m <- r * s_y/s_x
b <- mu_y - m*mu_x

# add regression line to plot
galton_heights %>%
    ggplot(aes(father, son)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_abline(intercept = b, slope = m)
```

<h3>Bivariate Normal Distribution</h3>

When a pair of random variables are approximated by the bivariate normal distribution, scatterplots look like ovals. They can be thin (high correlation) or circle-shaped (no correlation).
When two variables follow a bivariate normal distribution, computing the regression line is equivalent to computing conditional expectations.
We can obtain a much more stable estimate of the conditional expectation by finding the regression line and using it to make predictions.

```{r}
galton_heights %>%
  mutate(z_father = round((father - mean(father)) / sd(father))) %>%
  filter(z_father %in% -2:2) %>%
  ggplot() +  
  stat_qq(aes(sample = son)) +
  facet_wrap( ~ z_father)
```

There are two different regression lines depending on whether we are taking the expectation of Y given X or taking the expectation of X given Y.
```{r}
# compute a regression line to predict the son's height from the father's height
mu_x <- mean(galton_heights$father)
mu_y <- mean(galton_heights$son)
s_x <- sd(galton_heights$father)
s_y <- sd(galton_heights$son)
r <- cor(galton_heights$father, galton_heights$son)
m_1 <-  r * s_y / s_x
b_1 <- mu_y - m_1*mu_x

# compute a regression line to predict the father's height from the son's height
m_2 <-  r * s_x / s_y
b_2 <- mu_x - m_2*mu_y
```



```{r}

set.seed(1989) #if you are using R 3.5 or earlier
set.seed(1989, sample.kind="Rounding") #if you are using R 3.6 or later
library(HistData)
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data("GaltonFamilies")

female_heights <- GaltonFamilies%>%     
    filter(gender == "female") %>%     
    group_by(family) %>%     
    sample_n(1) %>%     
    ungroup() %>%     
    select(mother, childHeight) %>%     
    rename(daughter = childHeight)

#Daughter's height from motherâ€™s height.
mu_m <- mean(female_heights$mother)
mu_d <- mean(female_heights$daughter)
s_m <- sd(female_heights$mother)
s_d <- sd(female_heights$daughter)

#Correlation coefficient
r <- cor(female_heights$mother, female_heights$daughter)

#Slope of regression line predicting daughters' height from mothers' heights
m_1 <-  r * s_d / s_m

#Intercept of regression line predicting daughters' height from mothers' heights
b_1 <- mu_d - m_1*mu_m

#Change in daughter's height in inches given a 1 inch increase in the mother's height
r * s_y/s_x

#What percent of the variability in daughter heights is explained by the mother's height?
r^2 * 100

```

A mother has a height of 60 inches.

Using the regression formula, what is the conditional expected value of her daughter's height given the mother's height?

```{r}
 m = r * s_y/s_x
b = mu_y - (r * s_y/s_x)*mu_x
x = 60
m*x+b

```
